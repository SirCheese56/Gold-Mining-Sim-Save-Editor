Requirements

This tool requires **Python 3.9+**.

All / Most modules used are part of Python’s standard library:

- os  
- zipfile  
- tkinter  
- tkinter.ttk  
- xml.etree.ElementTree  
- shutil  

No external packages or pip installations are needed.

If you get an error such as:
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'`

It means your Python installation does not include Tkinter.  
In this case - type into your command prompt or into a VS Code terminal "pip install Tkinter" and that should solve the issue as long as python is set as a system variable.




Tutorial

- Run the python file and you will see a window pop up which will decompile the savedata for you automatically.
- Then select whichever values you would like to edit and change them using the Value boxes.
- If you are changing difficulty, I believe that 0 is the easiest, 1 is normal, and so on.
- Make sure to press "Apply pinned changes" or "Apply change" depending on what you have edited with
- Then ensure you press the Save changes to file button in the bottom left as this is what recompiles the file for you.
- Load the game (do not be put off if the save shows the old values as it is not defined on what the current values are but what the values were when you saved last)
- Enjoy your newly edited values.
